#Service time prediction of the 311 agencies service in the NYC

We aim to test out three different models — a linear regression, a neural network, and a decision tree — to see if we can predict how long it takes to resolve 311 calls. We anticipate that significant features could be the city agency responding, such as the Sanitation Department or the NYPD, the location of the caller, and the problem described by the caller.
